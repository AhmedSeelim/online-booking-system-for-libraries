## 1. Requirements & Planning

### My Role:
- Defined core problem statement and system objectives
- Outlined high-level features (books, resources, bookings, AI assistance)
- Set project scope and constraints

### AI Tool: **ChatGPT**

**Task:** Elaborate detailed requirements

**What ChatGPT Did:**
- Suggested detailed attributes for resources (type, capacity, hourly rate, features)
- Proposed book attributes (ISBN, categories, stock count, digital URL)
- Recommended booking properties (status types, duration limits)
- Suggested transaction fields (currency, status, refund handling)

**My Review:**
- Filtered suggestions based on importance and time constraints
- Removed unnecessary features
- Kept only essential attributes

## 2. Architecture Design

### My Role:
- Designed project structure (backend, frontend, database)
- Selected initial frameworks (FastAPI, React)
- Outlined three-crew AI agent architecture

### AI Tools: **ChatGPT + Gemini Pro**

**ChatGPT Contributions:**
- Validated layered architecture
- Reminded me about booking cancellation policies
- Suggested booking overlap prevention
- Recommended transaction rollback handling

**Gemini Pro Contributions:**
- Reviewed technology stack compatibility
- Recommended SQLite instead of PostgreSQL (better for project scope)
- Suggested SQLModel for database-agnostic design

**Result:** Switched to SQLite with easy PostgreSQL migration path

## 4. Database Seeding

### My Role:
- Defined demo data requirements (users, books, resources)

### AI Tool: **ChatGPT**

**What ChatGPT Did:**
- Created seed script with realistic demo data
- Generated 8 diverse books across categories
- Created 5 different resource types
- Set up admin and demo user accounts

---

## 5. AI Agent System

### My Role:
- Designed three-crew architecture (Receptionist, Books Officer, Resources Officer)
- Defined agent responsibilities and tools
- Wrote core agent logic

### AI Tools: **Claude + ChatGPT**

**Claude Contributions:**
- Improved code organization
- Enhanced error handling
- Structured configuration files (agents.yaml, tasks.yaml)

**ChatGPT Contributions:**
- Designed intent classification prompts
- Created agent conversation templates
- Wrote confirmation and error messages
- Developed cost calculation explanations

---

## 6. Frontend Development

### My Role:
- Designed UI/UX concept
- Defined pages (Home, Login, Books, Resources, My Bookings)
- Specified layouts and user flows

### AI Tool: **Google AI Studio (Gemini)**

**Iterative Prompting Approach:**

1. **Iteration 1:** Basic structure with routing
2. **Iteration 2:** Core components (Layout, AgentChat, Modal)
3. **Iteration 3:** API integration with Axios
4. **Iteration 4:** State management (AuthContext, AIActionContext)
5. **Iteration 5:** UI refinement (design, loading states, responsive)
6. **Iteration 6:** Final polish (animations, accessibility)

**Result:** Polished, functional frontend matching vision

## Key Success Factors

✅ **Clear Initial Vision** - Well-defined requirements before using AI
✅ **Strategic Tool Selection** - Used each tool for its strengths
✅ **Active Review** - Never blindly accepted AI output
✅ **Iterative Refinement** - Multiple rounds of improvement
✅ **Human Oversight** - Maintained control over core decisions

---

## Challenges

⚠️ AI tools often over-engineered solutions
⚠️ Required careful review to remove unnecessary features
⚠️ Had to refine prompts multiple times

---

## Conclusion

AI tools accelerated development by **60-70%**, but human oversight remained critical. Success came from:
- Using AI as an assistant, not a replacement
- Reviewing and filtering all suggestions
- Maintaining control over architecture and design
- Strategic use of different tools for different tasks

**Key Principle:** AI generates, human validates and refines.
